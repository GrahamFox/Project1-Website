            <h2>Never heard of E3?</h2>
            <p>The Electronic Entertainment Expo, commonly known as E3, is an annual trade fair for the video game industry presented by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA). It is used by many video game publishers and accessory manufacturers to introduce and advertise upcoming games and game-related merchandise. Unlike Gamescom and other video-game trade fairs open to the public, E3 is an industry-only event, individuals who wish to attend are required by the ESA to verify a professional connection to the video-game industry.</p>

          <h3 class="media-heading">Outlast 2</h3>
          <p>Like the original, the immediate takeaway from Outlast 2 is just how damn gorgeous the game is. Every single gross, maggot-covered severed limb looks exactly how I'd imagine a gross, maggot-covered severed limb would look like. Textures and objects in the environment are terrifyingly-realistic, low fog and walls of dust obscure your vision in a realistic and evocative way, and the night-vision camera effects from the original game are back to amp up the tension ten-fold. </p>
          <p>The core gameplay element of battery management from the original was definitely back in this demo for Outlast 2, which has me a bit worried. While I liked the tension that an ever-depleting battery delivered, I ultimately felt like it actively prevented me from exploring the rich, gorgeous, and terrifying world that Red Barrels created. Here’s to hoping that the mechanics of Outlast 2 rely less on this management, and more on some new gameplay tweaks and elements.</p>
          <p>hether this was a tone-piece meant to highlight some of the different types of horror that we’d see in the final game, or a demo that’s actually indicative of the rollercoaster ride we’ll be going on later this year remains to be seen, but my short time with Outlast 2 made it quite clear that PC, PS4, and Xbox One owners who like scaring the hell out of themselves have something to look forward to in 2016. </p>

          <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.</p>
          <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>

              <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
