          <h3>Titanfall</h3>
          <p>
            Fast-paced from the very get-go, Titanfall has all the elements of great PvP FPS. Throw in gigantic mech suits, and that's a recipe for brilliance.
            
            As soon as you pass the very intuitive and concise tutorial, you have the option of some very interesting looking playlists. These range from specific game types to a playthrough of the story. This is where we have our one and only criticism; what's going on isn't very clear. The only way you can play through a campaign is through online matchmaking, which results in any NPC dialogue being drowned out by the slanders and ramblings of your 'teammates' (unless you're fortunate enough to have a full fireteam of mates on your side).
            Despite this, Titanfall has a hook that grabbed us from the very get-go; the astounding aesthetics, the soundtrack, and the undiluted action make it a brilliant casual PvP. Our recommendation? Grab a beer, put your feet up, chill out with your pilot, and cut down enough opponents to call in your gargantuan metal weapon/buddy!

                <h3>Evolve</h3>
                <p>
                  Monsters. Hunters. Rapid evolution. Teamwork. Primal Ferocity. Militaristic Tactics.
                  Evolve literally has the best of both worlds. You like tight-nit plans and coordinated assault? Play as the Hunters; human soldiers perfectly suited to tracking and slaying the Beast. That is, unless you feel like harnessing the monster within; tear into indigenous wildlife to evolve yourself to the highest tier, and rip, tear, hack, slash and gouge your way through the tiny little humans.
                  The tutorial, while not the most intuitive, is simple enough to get through, and leaves you more than capable of going out into the big bad world to kill either human, or monster.
                  The beasts feel natural to control, and playing the humans is easy enough, but honestly, I personally didn't find it as much fun as the beasts. Evolve hinges on your ability to harness both your inner commander and godzilla to overcome the others playstyles, and honestly, it's possibly one of the most entertaining games I've played in a while that doesn't demand my full attention and can be played for the craic, not just because you want to progress in the story, or get a few more trophies or gamerpoionts, all the while being engaging.

              <h3>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3>
              <p>There's not that much to say about The Witcher 3. I love it. It's fucking brilliant! The visuals are astounding, the soundtrack is magical, the gameplay is so immersive that I have often forgotten to blink, only to go hours playing and then be in pain when I need to moisten my eyes again. The world feels real, likes it's actually part of some folklore, and again, it's amazing!
                Honestly, the Witcher is perfect. If someone thinks that it's anything other than brilliant, they're either lying, or an idiot! The Witcher 3 is fucking perfect! That's it!
                DROPS MIC!

                  <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
